What
---------------
This is practice of RUST chapter 2 - creating a guessing game with RUST. In this chapter I learned how to match(compare) two integeters and very basic exception handling. 

Why the code format is so ugly
------------------------------
I have not yet learned how to format things with EMACS. I am basically learning two things at the sametime (I am not sure if this is a good idea or not). I am learning EMACS as well as RUST. Anyway the code works so far. The format will be fixed later. sorry.
